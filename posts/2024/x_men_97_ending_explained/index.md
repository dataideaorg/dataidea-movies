## X-Men '97: Season 1 Ending Explained and What's Next for Season 2

> The Main Villain of Season 2 May Have Just Been Revealed

**Warning: This article contains full spoilers for X-Men ‘97: Season 1, Episode 10! Be sure to check out IGN’s review of the Season 1 finale if you haven't already.**

X-Men ‘97 has concluded its first season on Disney+, bringing significant changes in the wake of the final battle with Bastion. Although Operation: Zero Tolerance has been thwarted and the world saved from annihilation, the X-Men are now missing and presumed dead. As the world recovers, new conflicts are emerging across time.

### The X-Men Save the World (Again)

The finale's climax paints a dire picture for humanity. Despite Professor Xavier hijacking Magneto’s mind to undo the EMP attack, humanity still faces extinction as Bastion transforms Asteroid M into a deadly projectile. Bastion's plan is reminiscent of Ultron’s in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_.

Bastion is ultimately destroyed after rejecting Cyclops' act of compassion and being sucked into a black hole created by Asteroid M’s damaged core. Magneto, regaining consciousness just in time, prevents Asteroid M from crashing into Earth. However, the X-Men and Magneto are presumed dead after the asteroid explodes.

This heroic act sets a new tone for human/mutant relations in Season 2. Despite Bastion discrediting the X-Men and revealing the truth about Xavier’s death, the X-Men and Magneto's sacrifice have shown world leaders their willingness to protect humanity. Anti-mutant hysteria persists, but the X-Men’s heroism is a powerful counter-narrative.

### The Marvel Cameos in Episode 10

Episode 10 features numerous superhero cameos, including:

- Captain America
- Iron Man
- Black Panther (T’Chaka)
- Daredevil
- Cloak and Dagger
- Doctor Strange
- Silver Samurai
- Omega Red
- Dawnstar
- Peter Parker
- Mary Jane Watson

Former showrunner Beau DeMayo suggested that many heroes are off-world, dealing with a crisis involving the Shi’ar and Kree empires.

### Saved by Time Travel

The final scenes reveal that Magneto and the X-Men didn’t perish; they were transported across time. Most of them landed in ancient Egypt 5000 years ago, while Cyclops and Jean Grey found themselves 2000 years in the future.

This time travel may have been accidental, triggered by Bastion absorbing Cable’s time-traveling techno-organic arm. With Bastion’s destruction, time holes may have opened, pulling the X-Men into different eras.

Cable, now stranded in the present, could lead to the formation of X-Force, filling the void left by the X-Men.

### Meeting Apocalypse in Ancient Egypt

Magneto, Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, and Xavier find themselves in Egypt in 3000 BC, where they encounter En Sabah Nur, the young Apocalypse. This ancient mutant, often depicted as one of the first mutants, has a futuristic temple in the background, hinting at his battle with the time-traveler Pharaoh Rama-Tut.

Rama-Tut, an alias of Kang the Conqueror, might play a significant role in Season 2. The conflict between Apocalypse and Rama-Tut, with the X-Men’s involvement, could alter En Sabah Nur’s destiny, potentially preventing him from becoming a villain.

### Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Clan Askani

Cyclops and Jean Grey arrive in 3060 AD, encountering Clan Askani led by Mother Askani. They meet a younger Nathan Summers, their son, allowing them to regain lost time. This plot mirrors the 1994 comic series _The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix_, where Scott and Jean were psychically transported to the future to raise Nathan.

Clan Askani opposes Apocalypse’s rule, indicating a connected storyline across time with Apocalypse as the central villain.

### The Fate of Wolverine and the Other X-Men

Wolverine, Storm, and Morph are missing, leaving their whereabouts unknown. Given their popularity, it’s unlikely they died on Asteroid M. They may have been displaced in time as well.

Wolverine, injured with adamantium ripped from his bones, might have to recover physically and psychologically. His healing factor might be compromised, and he may discover his bone claws. Wolverine could face villains like Lady Deathstrike and Cyber while navigating his new reality.

### X-Men ‘97’s Post-Credits Scene Explained

The post-credits scene shows Apocalypse on Genosha, mourning mutant losses and holding a Gambit card, suggesting Gambit might be resurrected as his Horseman of Death. Apocalypse’s presence across past, future, and present hints at a central role in Season 2.

Season 2 is expected to delve into the connections across time and Apocalypse’s influence, likely returning in 2025.
