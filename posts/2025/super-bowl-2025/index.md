The Super Bowl is as much about the spectacle as it is about the football. That tradition of spectacle includes the commercials: Super Bowl ads tend to be big swings, featuring a lot of celebrities and attention-grabbing ploys. That usually includes movie trailers for the year’s upcoming blockbusters (and hopeful blockbusters). In recent years, though, Super Bowl movie trailers have become short teasers for the full-length ads playing online. Super Bowl LIX was a showcase for superheroes, live-action remakes of animated movies, dinosaurs, and Tom Cruise, but only in 30-second spots that point to longer trailers online.

Here are all the big (albeit short) movie trailers from this year’s Super Bowl, some of which were released well in advance of The Big Game:

## Thunderbolts*

Marvel Studios’ *Thunderbolts* got a very short TV spot during the Super Bowl itself, but that was just a taste of the much longer trailer. A new look at Marvel’s new ragtag team of misfits and kinda-bad guys offers us a clearer look at its kinda-big-bad guy, Sentry, a Superman-like with a complicated backstory.

**Release Date:** May 2

_Surely by then we’ll know what that asterisk is all about._

## Jurassic World Rebirth

</div>

We got our first look at *Jurassic World Rebirth* a few days before Super Bowl LIX, but a new Big Game Spot shows a little bit more of the relaunched franchise. Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and Mahershala Ali lead the new *Jurassic World* movie, which sends an extraction team to the island research facility for the original *Jurassic Park*, which is inhabited by the “worst of the worst” dinos.

**Release Date:** July 2

## Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning

Again, the Super Bowl spot for *Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning* is just a taste of a longer, already released trailer, but it has the No. 1 thing you want: Tom Cruise hanging off the side of a plane. The eighth *Mission: Impossible* movie, a direct sequel to 2023’s *Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One*, is coming to movie theaters soon.

**Release Date:** May 23

## How to Train Your Dragon

The Big Game Spot for DreamWorks’ live-action remake of *How to Train Your Dragon* is a trailer… for a trailer! But unlike other movie studios that want you to immediately run to YouTube for the longer version, Universal is hoping you’ll check back in on Wednesday, when the full trailer drops. For now, enjoy the live-action (and CGI) versions of Hiccup and Toothless while you wait.

**Release Date:** June 13

## Novocaine

*The Boys’* star Jack Quaid leads a new action-thriller with a fun premise: Quaid’s character Nate Caine can’t feel any pain, so his incredibly violent mission to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend, played by *Prey* star Amber Midthunder, leaves him feeling nothing. Nate gets stabbed, shot, and beaten up, but shrugs it off. The guy even deep-fries his hand at one point, just to let you know what you’re in for.

**Release Date:** March 14

## Lilo & Stitch

<div class="video-wrapper">

    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

Disney’s spot for the live-action *Lilo & Stitch* remake is less of a traditional movie trailer and more of an on-the-field appreciation of the adorable Stitch. If you want more of that cuteness, you may want to catch up on the previous *Lilo & Stitch* trailer that dropped late last year.

**Release Date:** May 23

## Smurfs

The new *Smurfs* movie stars John Goodman as the voice of Papa Smurf, who is captured by evil wizards Razamel and Gargamel, sending the Smurfs on a rescue mission. The voice cast includes Rihanna (as Smurfette), James Corden, Nick Offerman, JP Karliak, Daniel Levy, Amy Sedaris, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, Octavia Spencer, Nick Kroll, Hannah Waddingham, Alex Winter, Maya Erskine, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, and Kurt Russell.

**Release Date:** July 18
