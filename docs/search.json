    "text": "IMDb\n\n\nThe animated comedy Family Guy has had a lasting effect on viewers with its signature brand of comedy. Creator Seth MacFarlane crafted a comedic format that’s beloved by many. Premiering on Fox in 1999, the show struggled with ratings for three seasons, with its time slot frequently changed. Fox canceled Family Guy in 2002. However, the show found its audience through home video sales, Kazaa file sharing, and broadcasts on Adult Swim. Fox revived the series in 2005, and it remains strong, now in its 22nd season.\nWe’re celebrating the 20 best Family Guy episodes from Season 1 to Season 16, featuring the perfect mix of pop culture references, blue humor, and non-sequitur storytelling. Nearly all of these episodes prominently feature Brian and Stewie. Here are the episodes, listed in chronological order:\n“Da Boom”\nSeason 2, Episode 3\nTiming is key here. This episode originally aired on December 26, 1999, a prime position to goof on Y2K conspiracists. Peter takes his family into the basement to watch the clock strike midnight, and when it does, everyone’s worst fears come true: planes fall from the sky, trains derail, and nuclear warheads launch. The rest of the episode is a dystopian dark comedy, where the Griffins search for other human life and try to rebuild society. “Da Boom” also features the first Giant Chicken Fight, a famous recurring gag.\n“Death is a Bitch”\nSeason 2, Episode 6\nDeath comes for Peter’s soul, but when Death sprains his ankle chasing Peter, Peter must take on Death’s role. Adam Carolla regularly voices Death, but in this episode, Death’s first appearance, he was voiced by Norm MacDonald, whose laid-back, sarcastic delivery was perfect.\n\n\n\n\n“Road to Rhode Island”\nSeason 2, Episode 13\nThe first “Road to…” episode, starring Brian and Stewie, was presented as special; instead of the regular piano introduction, the show began with still shots of Brian and Stewie on various adventures. This buddy comedy follows Brian and Stewie as they track down Brian’s mother, delving deeper into the characters than before. This, along with the earlier Season 1 episode “Brian: Portrait of a Dog,” proved the show could be more than just a random collection of cutaways.\n“Lethal Weapons”\nSeason 3, Episode 7\nThis episode features two main intersecting plotlines: rude New Yorkers visiting Rhode Island to see the changing leaves and Lois taking martial arts lessons and learning to stand up for herself. The episode culminates in a critique of violence, resolved in typical Family Guy style with an all-out brawl.\n“To Love and Die in Dixie”\nSeason 3, Episode 12\nChris witnesses a crime, and the family enters witness protection in the Deep South. Stewie starts a bluegrass band, Peter disrupts a Civil War reenactment, and Chris falls in love with a Southern girl named Sam (whom he initially mistakes for a boy). Chris and Sam’s goodbye is sweet and touching.\n\n\n\n\n“PTV”\nSeason 4, Episode 14\nWhen Family Guy returned after its cancellation, it took a few episodes to regain its footing. “PTV,” a clever takedown of the FCC and its draconian prudery, marked the show’s stride. It features one of the best Family Guy songs ever written—so good that Brian and Stewie performed a version of it at the 2007 Emmys.\n“Meet The Quagmires”\nSeason 5, Episode 18\nThis time travel episode explores an alternate future where Peter misses his chance to marry Lois, and Quagmire marries her instead. In later seasons, the humanity in Peter and Lois’ marriage dwindles, but this episode makes their love feel believable and real. The episode concludes with a tribute to Back To The Future and a Broadway-esque Rick Roll, courtesy of Brian.\n“Believe It or Not, Joe’s Walking on Air”\nSeason 6, Episode 4\nJoe gets a new pair of legs, can walk again (just go with it), and becomes a complete douchebro as a result. The episode ends with Peter, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Bonnie trying to maim Joe because they liked him better when he was handicapped. A crass and mean-spirited episode overall, but funny enough to overlook its worst aspects.\n\n\n\n\n“McStroke”\nSeason 6, Episode 8\nSometimes, a Family Guy episode seems like a collection of random jokes rather than an actual plot. “McStroke” is one such episode, where Peter grows a mustache, has a stroke, and exposes a fast food corporation—all in a convoluted plot. The individual parts are so funny that the lack of cohesion matters less. Meanwhile, Stewie attends Chris and Meg’s school as Zac Sawyer and quickly becomes the most popular boy in school.\n“Road to Germany”\nSeason 7, Episode 3\nA time travel episode, “Road to Germany” transports Brian, Stewie, and Mort Goldman to Warsaw, Poland in 1939, right before the Nazi occupation. Their efforts to return to the present day take them to both London and Berlin, where Stewie dresses as Hitler to steal some uranium. The “mirror gag,” where Stewie Hitler meets the real Hitler, is an old vaudeville routine lifted from the Marx Brothers’ classic film “Duck Soup.”\n“Road to the Multiverse”\nSeason 8, Episode 1\nIf there’s a single episode to showcase as the best of the series—proof of the show’s comedic value and creativity—“Road to the Multiverse” is a strong candidate. Stewie builds a contraption that allows him and Brian to travel to infinite alternate universes. The funniest is the Disney universe, where every character is reimagined as a Disney-style animation, complete with singing animals and a Disney-esque ballad titled “It’s a Wonderful Day for Pie.”\n\n\n\n\n“And Then There Were Fewer”\nSeason 9, Episode 1\nIn Agatha Christie’s mystery novel “And Then There Were None,” ten people are trapped on an island during a storm, and they begin dying one by one, realizing that one of them is the murderer. “And Then There Were Fewer” is Family Guy’s tribute to the British ‘locked room’ mystery genre. It also leads to the permanent deaths of two main characters.\n“Brian Writes A Bestseller”\nSeason 9, Episode 7\nOne of the best running jokes in the series is Brian’s misadventures as a writer. He’s terrible, and that forms the main plot of “Brian Writes A Bestseller.” Brian sets out to write a terrible self-help book, and in a Producers-esque twist, it becomes a national bestseller. The success goes to his head, and he ends up humiliated by Bill Maher on Politically Incorrect. Stewie, who works as Brian’s manager, is the perfect comic foil as Brian becomes a spoiled diva.\n“Road to the North Pole”\nSeason 9, Episode 7\nA bawdy Christmas special with a lot of heart, “Road to the North Pole” stars Brian and Stewie. They find Santa close to death due to exhaustion and excessive demands and decide to deliver the presents in his stead. The attempt is, of course, an unmitigated disaster and features some of the darkest comedy in the show’s history. However, the episode manages to convey a heartfelt message against greed and materialism.\n\n\n\n\n“Back to the Pilot”\nSeason 10, Episode 5\nFamily Guy excels when it goes meta, and this episode, where Brian and Stewie travel back to the pilot episode of Season 1, serves as a self-analysis of the show’s evolution. The episode plays on every time travel paradox and loophole, culminating in a sequence where hundreds of Stewies and Brians from multiple timelines debate about whether to change the past to alter the future.\n“Lois Comes Out Of Her Shell”\nSeason 11, Episode 6\nLois has a midlife crisis, triggered by the worst imaginable birthday toast from Peter. Although Peter likes the new Lois, he eventually can’t keep up. The episode ends with Peter beating up Justin Bieber and reasserting his love for Lois. The B-plot, where Stewie adopts a homicidal turtle, provides a zany complement.\n“Roads to Vegas”\nSeason 11, Episode 21\nThe Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “Second Chances” deals with a transporter accident that creates two William Rikers. “Roads to Vegas” has an identical plotline; Stewie and Brian use a transporter to travel to Las Vegas, and the transporter creates a duplicate Brian and Stewie. Each set goes to Las Vegas unknowingly, and while one wins big, the other loses all its money and becomes indebted to a loan shark. Well-plotted, clever, and well-resolved, “Roads to Vegas” further proves that Brian and Stewie are the most fleshed-out, funniest characters on the show.\n\n\nDon’t miss out on any updates and developments! Subscribe to the DATAIDEA Newsletter it’s easy and safe.\n\n\n\n\n“Baking Bad”\nSeason 13, Episode 3\nPeter and Lois start a cookie shop that Peter, despite his best intentions, slowly transforms into a strip club. In the B-plot, Stewie gets addicted to cough syrup, and Brian holds an intervention with all of Stewie’s stuffed animals. “Baking Bad” features Cookie Monster, who bookends the episode with\n\n\n\n Back to top"

By the end, his friends didn’t recognize the survivor, and the British government changed the policy to make lighthouse keeper teams three people instead of two."

The Conjuring is based on the Warrens’ reports of the Perron family, who moved into a house in Rhode Island possessed by the spirit of a witch. Other cases in the Warrens’ archive have inspired the Annabelle movies, the Amityville franchise, and The Haunting in Connecticut — and all have been called into question by skeptics who believe the Warrens were charlatans."

The movie is a semi-high concept mix of classic exorcism horror and courtroom drama, telling the story of a priest who attempted an exorcism on a young girl who ultimately died, leaving him possibly liable for her death. The story was inspired by the real case behind the death of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who was subjected to 67 exorcism rites in the year before her death from malnutrition, and her parents and the priest who performed the rites were subsequently convicted of negligent homicide.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\n\nTo be among the first to hear about future updates, simply enter your email below, follow us on  (formally Twitter)."

Open Water (2003)\nShark attacks are rare, but given the number of movies that claim to be based on true stories of people getting chomped in the middle of the ocean, you’d think they happen all the time. Open Water is one of these movies that claims to be based on fact, and in some ways this is true. The movie was inspired by the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, a pair of American vacationers whose scuba diving trip turned deadly when they were accidentally left behind in the middle of Australia’s Coral Sea after the boat crew failed to take an accurate headcount. Neither has been found but both are presumed dead — however, it’s unlikely that their ends were as gruesome as those suffered by the characters in Open Water.\n\n\n\nYou may also like:\n\n\n\nThe Best 10 AI Movies of All Time"

    "title": "China’s Zhang Yimou to Direct ‘Three-Body Problem’ Movie",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by DATAIDEA\n\n\nThe celebrated auteur will tackle a Chinese-language feature adaptation of Liu Cixin’s best-selling sci-fi book, which Netflix also brought to screen in its mega-budget series.\nLiu Cixin’s best-selling sci-fi book, The Three-Body Problem, is heading home to China for another screen adaptation. Zhang Yimou, arguably China’s most revered living filmmaker, is set to direct a Chinese-language feature film based on the novel, it was revealed Sunday during a forum at the Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\nIn Shanghai, Wang Changtian, chairman of leading local studio Beijing Enlight Media, said his company was in the early stages of developing the project, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Three-Body Universe Cultural Development Co., a subsidiary of Yoozoo Pictures and the copyright holder for the book and related media, also confirmed the project was in the works.\nNews of Zhang’s involvement in a Chinese take on the beloved sci-fi saga lit up Chinese social media Monday. The Three-Body Problem, the first book in Cixin’s Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy, has spawned several adaptations across different media since its release in 2014 — with decidedly mixed success. A prior Chinese-language film adaptation of the book directed by Fanfan Zhang was never completed, but a Chinese TV adaptation by Tencent, titled Three-Body, did make it to the screen in 2023 and streamed on Peacock earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\nIn the West, the best-known adaptation is Netflix’s big-budget take, restyled as 3 Body Problem, and helmed by Alexander Woo and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. The U.S. version has been considered a global hit, with Netflix renewing it for a second and third season that will complete the showrunners’ vision of the books’ full story. But in China, the reaction to the Netflix version has been decidedly mixed, with criticisms ranging from the show’s diverse, mostly non-Chinese key cast — a Chinese state media editorial attacked the adaptation as “American cultural hegemony” created under the guise of diversity — to some of the liberties that were taken with Liu Cixin’s beloved story. However, many in China — where Netflix is blocked and piracy is the only way to access the series — also undeniably liked the show, as plenty of social media chatter praised its scale and faithfulness to the spirit of the novels (a social media post from the state-run Global Times news outlet later accused foreign press of exaggerating the negative reactions to the show in order to stir up political tensions and portray Chinese viewers as unreasonably nationalistic). The Three-Body Problem media property has also been the subject of international intrigue for all the wrong reasons: In a shocking turn of events, a disgruntled employee of Three Body Universe in 2020 murdered Yoozoo’s founder and CEO, Lin Qi, who was credited with spearheading many of the book’s screen adaptations, including the Netflix version.\n\n\n\n\nAmid this complicated milieu around the various adaptations, no figure would be considered a safer pair of hands among Chinese fans than Zhang. A key figure of China’s Fifth Generation of filmmakers, he is beloved by film buffs at home and abroad for his films Raise the Red Lantern, Red Sorghum, To Live, Hero, and House of the Flying Daggers. He also directed the stunning opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\nIn recent years, however, his output has been directed squarely — and successfully — at the domestic Chinese moviegoer. In just the past year and a half, the 72-year-old director has released three films — little seen outside China — that have collectively earned $1.15 billion in his country. His recent period comedy thriller, Full River Red, produced by Huanxi Media, was China’s top-grossing movie of 2023 with a staggering box office haul of $634.6 million. He followed that up with Beijing Enlight Pictures’ crime drama Under the Light, also released in 2023, which earned $190 million. And he was back again near the start of 2024 with the Chinese Lunar New Year release of comedy-drama Article 20, produced again by Enlight and earning $323.6 million. One genre that Zhang had yet to tackle across his nearly 40-year career in cinema is futuristic sci-fi — and that will soon change.\n\n\nDon’t miss out on any updates and developments!

    "title": "Furiosa Proves That Anya Taylor-Joy is One of Our Modern Movie Stars",
    "section": "",
    "text": "IMDb\n\n\nIt took almost a decade, but Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is finally in theaters. The long-awaited prequel to 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, the latest entry in director George Miller’s post-apocalyptic franchise, centers on Imperator Furiosa’s backstory and makes for a fascinating contrast with the previous film. Where Fury Road was essentially one long high-octane thrill ride, Furiosa is a far more patient wasteland odyssey, telling the story of its heroine over many years. It’s a great movie for many reasons, particularly Miller’s strong direction and the film’s deliberate pace, but most of all because of Anya Taylor-Joy’s performance in the lead role.\nOf course, we love what Charlize Theron brought to the part in Fury Road, but the recasting goes to show not just how much new life a franchise project can be injected with by allowing a new actor to take on an iconic character, but also that Taylor-Joy is one of best examples of a 21st century movie star. How so? Let’s take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an Imperator\nThe road to bringing the Furiosa film to the big screen was quite different from most other blockbuster prequels. In an interview with AV Club, Miller said the screenplay for Furiosa was “virtually complete” before Fury Road’s production, meaning the story of this film was known to Miller and his collaborators before the former was even released. Charlize Theron even confirmed that she read the script for Furiosa as part of her preparation for shooting Fury Road. Her deep knowledge of Furiosa’s backstory informed her performance in that film, and helps this movie feel like a perfectly natural extension of its predecessor in terms of character, theme, and world-building. Conventional wisdom would hold that Theron would reprise the role, but Miller decided to move in a different direction.\nPart of that was because he wasn’t convinced by the current state of digital de-aging technology. Speaking to Variety, he said, “I saw not only The Irishman, but Ang Lee’s Gemini Man, with Will Smith. Both of them were masterful directors, but it was never persuasive. I thought all people would be watching is Charlize looking young and knowing it’s an effect.” The long hiatus between Fury Road’s release and Furiosa’s production also made it clear to the veteran director that he wanted to find a new actor to take up the part, which he finally found in Anya Taylor-Joy after seeing her performance in an early cut of Edgar Wright’s (underrated) psychological horror film Last Night in Soho. Wright elaborated on this story on social media, saying that he connected the pair a mere two days before the COVID-19 lockdowns in March of 2020.\nGiven how well Fury Road was received by both critics and audiences, recasting such a pivotal character for her spin-off film was certainly a gamble. After all, Furiosa really is the main protagonist of Fury Road anyway, with Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky being more “along for the ride” as opposed to driving the action in any significant capacity. A project that further explores the characters, factions, and visual motifs established by Fury Road would necessitate Furiosa’s inclusion because of how intertwined she is with them. Yet, more so than any other creative choice he makes in the final product, Miller allowing Taylor-Joy to bring her own spin on the character is what most helps the film feel like an essential installment in the Mad Max mythos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnya Taylor-Fury\nAt a moment when plenty of digital ink has been spilled wondering if we still have movie stars, Anya Taylor-Joy has emerged as one of the few actors to rise within the last decade or so who deserves the title. Ever since her phenomenal debut performance in Robert Eggers’ 2015 horror masterpiece The Witch, Taylor-Joy has captivated several of the industry’s top directors, such as the aforementioned Edgar Wright, M. Night Shyamalan, Denis Villeneuve, and of course, George Miller. Beyond her work with auteurs, she’s also made a distinct impression on audiences in the Netflix show The Queen’s Gambit (for which she received an Emmy nomination), the surprise hit black comedy/horror film The Menu, and even added a billion dollar grosser to her resume with her voice role as Princess Peach in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nThat’s a lot to achieve in such a short time, and if Furiosa is any indication, the Argentinian sensation’s career won’t be slowing down anytime soon. What makes her performance as Furiosa so enthralling besides her natural talent is how well the story takes advantage of the differences in performing style between her and Theron. Where Theron played Furiosa as raw rage barely contained, Taylor-Joy is far calmer, her anger simmering behind the glares she gives from across the room (or the wasteland). There’s a palpable sense that the terrors she sees and endures in this movie are what leave the Furiosa of Fury Road such an exhausted and enraged main hero. During much of the prequel’s events, Furiosa’s will to survive and fire to take vengeance on her tormentors is still driven just as much by the vestiges of her idealism as her darker impulses. Her one-woman war against Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) is what finally breaks her down, what forges her into the character audiences fell in love with in Fury Road.\nThat Taylor-Joy communicates all of this mostly with her eyes and physicality — since the script gives her minimal dialogue — reinforces how forward-thinking of a choice it was for Miller to recast the role. Theron is perfectly capable of conveying those emotions, but the part of Furiosa’s internal journey we see in this new film is ideally suited to Taylor-Joy’s skills. More so than most actors currently working, Taylor-Joy is at her best when we can read everything her character is thinking along the lines of her face, in the details of her eyes. That sense of patient fury, of holding in her true feelings until she simply can’t anymore, is what gives her take on Furiosa an entirely new dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKill Them With Courage\nIt takes serious artistic courage to step into the shoes of a pre-established iconic character and put so much of her own spin on the material, but that’s exactly what Taylor-Joy does. It’s a stark reminder that if there’s any one thing that’s pushed her to the front of the pack in her generation of actors, it’s her insistence on making bold choices, a mindset she’s embraced as far back as the beginning of her career. In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, she revealed that she had to choose between her role in The Witch or a Disney Channel pilot. On the reason she went with the former, Taylor-Joy said, “I just had this really good feeling about ‘The Witch’ that made me willing to forgo the Disney experience for the thing that felt unknown to me, the thing that felt sacred.”\nChoosing roles where she digs deep into dark and messy territory with her characters has been the key to her artistic success ever since. Sure, she has screen presence and charisma to burn, but she also makes a point to challenge herself by playing characters where there are no easy answers as to how you’re supposed to feel about them. We’ve seen this with Thomasin in The Witch, Beth Harmon in The Queen’s Gambit, and Sandie in Last Night in Soho, all of whom register as sympathetic but thorny in equal measure. Even some of her lesser known films, such as Thoroughbreds and the 2020 adaptation of Emma, feature her playing with the boundaries of what’s expected out of conventional protagonists (and in the case of the latter, she even willed herself into a nosebleed in-character. Really.)\nIf anything, Furiosa is simply one more entry in a long line of confirmations that whatever else is going on in Hollywood, Anya Taylor-Joy is certain to be a big part of its future. She’s the kind of brave and idiosyncratic performer we only see a few times in a generation, and so many brand name directors falling over each other to get her in their films should be more than enough evidence that she has the proverbial “it” factor. As a film, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a stunning piece, but it wouldn’t get quite that far without an actor like Taylor-Joy in the lead role to help it over the finish line. She was trusted to take a character audiences knew and loved and make her her own, and given how well she knocks it out of the park, it’s practically guaranteed that even more high profile filmmakers will trust her with their projects going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Be sure to check out IGN’s review of the Season 1 finale if you haven’t already.\nX-Men ’97 has concluded its first season on Disney+, bringing significant changes in the wake of the final battle with Bastion. Although Operation: Zero Tolerance has been thwarted and the world saved from annihilation, the X-Men are now missing and presumed dead. As the world recovers, new conflicts are emerging across time.\n\nThe X-Men Save the World (Again)\nThe finale’s climax paints a dire picture for humanity. Despite Professor Xavier hijacking Magneto’s mind to undo the EMP attack, humanity still faces extinction as Bastion transforms Asteroid M into a deadly projectile. Bastion’s plan is reminiscent of Ultron’s in Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nBastion is ultimately destroyed after rejecting Cyclops’ act of compassion and being sucked into a black hole created by Asteroid M’s damaged core. Magneto, regaining consciousness just in time, prevents Asteroid M from crashing into Earth. However, the X-Men and Magneto are presumed dead after the asteroid explodes.\nThis heroic act sets a new tone for human/mutant relations in Season 2. Despite Bastion discrediting the X-Men and revealing the truth about Xavier’s death, the X-Men and Magneto’s sacrifice have shown world leaders their willingness to protect humanity. Anti-mutant hysteria persists, but the X-Men’s heroism is a powerful counter-narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marvel Cameos in Episode 10\nEpisode 10 features numerous superhero cameos, including:\n\nCaptain America\nIron Man\nBlack Panther (T’Chaka)\nDaredevil\nCloak and Dagger\nDoctor Strange\nSilver Samurai\nOmega Red\nDawnstar\nPeter Parker\nMary Jane Watson\n\nFormer showrunner Beau DeMayo suggested that many heroes are off-world, dealing with a crisis involving the Shi’ar and Kree empires.\n\n\nSaved by Time Travel\nThe final scenes reveal that Magneto and the X-Men didn’t perish; they were transported across time. Most of them landed in ancient Egypt 5000 years ago, while Cyclops and Jean Grey found themselves 2000 years in the future.\nThis time travel may have been accidental, triggered by Bastion absorbing Cable’s time-traveling techno-organic arm. With Bastion’s destruction, time holes may have opened, pulling the X-Men into different eras.\nCable, now stranded in the present, could lead to the formation of X-Force, filling the void left by the X-Men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Apocalypse in Ancient Egypt\nMagneto, Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, and Xavier find themselves in Egypt in 3000 BC, where they encounter En Sabah Nur, the young Apocalypse. This ancient mutant, often depicted as one of the first mutants, has a futuristic temple in the background, hinting at his battle with the time-traveler Pharaoh Rama-Tut.\nRama-Tut, an alias of Kang the Conqueror, might play a significant role in Season 2. The conflict between Apocalypse and Rama-Tut, with the X-Men’s involvement, could alter En Sabah Nur’s destiny, potentially preventing him from becoming a villain.\n\n\nCyclops, Jean Grey, and Clan Askani\nCyclops and Jean Grey arrive in 3060 AD, encountering Clan Askani led by Mother Askani. They meet a younger Nathan Summers, their son, allowing them to regain lost time. This plot mirrors the 1994 comic series The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, where Scott and Jean were psychically transported to the future to raise Nathan.\nClan Askani opposes Apocalypse’s rule, indicating a connected storyline across time with Apocalypse as the central villain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fate of Wolverine and the Other X-Men\nWolverine, Storm, and Morph are missing, leaving their whereabouts unknown. Given their popularity, it’s unlikely they died on Asteroid M. They may have been displaced in time as well.\nWolverine, injured with adamantium ripped from his bones, might have to recover physically and psychologically. His healing factor might be compromised, and he may discover his bone claws. Wolverine could face villains like Lady Deathstrike and Cyber while navigating his new reality.\n\n\nX-Men ’97’s Post-Credits Scene Explained\nThe post-credits scene shows Apocalypse on Genosha, mourning mutant losses and holding a Gambit card, suggesting Gambit might be resurrected as his Horseman of Death. Apocalypse’s presence across past, future, and present hints at a central role in Season 2.\nSeason 2 is expected to delve into the connections across time and Apocalypse’s influence, likely returning in 2025.\nFor more on X-Men ’97, explore why the series takes a minimalist approach with Wolverine and stay updated on every Marvel movie and series in development."
